/*
    contains the classes that represent data transfer objects (DTOs). 
    These classes are typically used to transfer data between different 
    layers of the application, such as controllers and services. 
    DTOs are useful for decoupling the application layers and preventing 
    changes in one layer from affecting other layers.
